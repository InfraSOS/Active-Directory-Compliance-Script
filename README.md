# Active Directory Compliance Powershell Script
Free Active Directory Compliance tool for CIS benchmarks, SOX, NIST, GDPR and HIPAA.  Iâ€™ve created a Powershell script that outputs a HTML report on the status of your Active Directory in regards to your compliance.  Run on as many domains as you need.  You can run it remotely, just specify the domain controller and the script will run against your DC.
